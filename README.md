### OpenAI Client

This repository implements an asynchronous client for interacting with OpenAI's API. You'll need an API key which you can generate [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). This does require a paid account.

### Status

This client is not production ready yet. Many features still need to be implemented that I will get to in the next few weeks. CI still needs to be built. Once it's ready, I'll upload it to crates.io.

### Building and Testing

Clone this repository. Create a file called `.env` and fill in your API key. An example env file is in the repository. Run `cargo test` to ensure the tests pass.
